implementation:
     - If no parameters are specified, the program 
        must not display anything and give the prompt back

     - The first argument should be at the top of the
        stack (be careful about the order).
  
     - In case of error, it must display "Error" followed 
        by a ’\n’ on the standard error.
     - Errors include for example: some arguments aren’t 
        integers, some arguments are bigger than an 
        integer and/or there are duplicates.

Scripts:
	 -  make Script that receive numbers and excecute 
	 	 push_swap with thats numbers
	 -  

Makefile:
     - Hide objects compilations from ft_printf & libft
     - Show a message something like "ft_printf & libft 
        suscess"

Attention:
     - The first argument should be at the top of the 
    stack (be careful about the order).
